A FFXI Ashita addon to relatively quickly use any ability/spell without text commands or menuing.

Pressing ';' opens the input window.
While it's open, you can type a search term and use a listed action by pressing keys '1'-'0'.
This will perform the action's ja/pet/ws/ma command with a context-specific target select.

To cancel, press ';' again or Esc.

Pressing Enter will pick the top-most action and instantly cast it, because that's how Enter works.
